# react-native-boilerplate-nrt

This is simple Boilerplate to make starting a POC's development easier with react-native

# üí™ Motivation

Long time without working with react native and I wanted to develop something to make my poc's easier for me and the community.

## Why don't use this project to production?

I believe this is not the best project to start a "real production project", because probably will need so many improviment's (ex: state management, style system, notification, firebase etc...)

I hope this project can help you to improve our skills in something you never did in react-native (ex: react-native-skia)
